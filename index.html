            <h3>Playable Combinations</h3>
            <p>There are four types of legal play: single cards, pairs, triples and five card groups.</p>
            
            <h4>Single cards</h4>
            <p>These rank from two (high) down to three (low), and between cards of the same rank a higher suit beats a lower suit.</p>
            <h4>Pairs</h4>
            <p>A pair of equal ranked cards twos are highest and threes are lowest. Any higher ranked pair beats one with lower ranks. Between equal ranked pairs, the one containing the highest suit is better - for example ♠9-♦9 beats ♥9-♣9 because the ♠ is higher than the ♥.</p>
            <h4>Triples</h4>
            <p>Three equal ranked cards - three twos are highest, then aces, kings, etc. down to three threes, which is the lowest triple.</p>
            <h4>Five card groups</h4>
            <p>There five types of playable five-card combination. From weakest to strongest they are: straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush.</p>
            <p>A <b>Straight</b> consists of five cards of consecutive rank with mixed suits. A straight with higher ranks beats a lower one, irrespective of the suits of the cards. When the ranks are the same, the suit of the highest card determines which is higher. So for example ♦9-♥10-♣J-♣Q-♦K beats ♦8-♦9-♦10-♦J-♠Q, which beats ♠8-♠9-♠10-♠J-♦Q. Twos rank highest in straights, so the highest straight is J-Q-K-A-2. Any card can be used to start a straight, for example A-2-3-4-5, which is beaten by 2-3-4-5-6 and 3-4-5-6-7, etc.</p>
            <p>A <b>Flush</b> consists of any five cards of the same suit. A flush in a higher suit beats a flush in a lower suit, irrespective of the ranks of the cards. Between two flushes with the same suit, the one with the higher top card is better. So for example ♥3-♥5-♥6-♥7-♥9 beats ♣4-♣6-♣9-♣J-♣2, which beats ♣7-♣10-♣Q-♣K-♣A.</p>
            <p>A <b>Full House</b> consists of three cards of one rank and two of another rank; between two full houses, the fullhouse with the higher triple wins - for example fullhouse 9's (9-9-9-4-4) beats fullhouse 8's (8-8-8-K-K).</p>
            <p><b>Four of a kind (or quads)</b> are made up of all four cards of the same rank, plus any fifth card (a kicker card). The fifth card must be included - four equal cards by themselves are not a playable combination. Between two four of a kind combos, the higher four of a kind wins.
                <p>A <b>Straight Flush</b> consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. The rank of the highest card determines which of two straight flushes is higher; between two equal ranked straight flushes, the one in the higher suit is better, so the highest straight flush would be ♠10-♠J-♠Q-♠K-♠A-♠2 which is the highest possible five-card combination.</p>
            <p>A combination can only be beaten by a better combination with the same number of cards: so a single card can only be beaten by a single card, a pair by a better pair and a triple by a better triple. You cannot for example use a triple to beat a pair or a straight to beat a triple. However, a five card group can be beaten by a five card group of a stronger type - any flush beats any straight, any full house beats any straight or flush, any four of a kind plus an odd card beats any straight, flush or full house and any straight flush beats all of the other type of five card group.</p>
